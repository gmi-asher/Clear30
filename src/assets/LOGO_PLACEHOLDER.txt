LOGO PLACEHOLDER
================

You need to add the Clear30 logo to this directory as 'logo.png'

The logo should be:
- Named: logo.png
- Format: PNG (or SVG)
- Recommended size: 300-400px wide
- Transparent background preferred
- Brand colors: Teal (#5BB4A9) and Green (#80C97A)

A temporary SVG logo (logo.svg) has been provided for testing purposes.
To use it temporarily, update the import in Footer.jsx from:
  import logo from '../assets/logo.png'
to:
  import logo from '../assets/logo.svg'

For production, replace this with your actual Clear30 logo file.
